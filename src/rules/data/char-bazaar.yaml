rules:
  1:
    headline: The 'For Sale/Auction' post must be made by the character being offered.
    details: >
      This is being added to prevent scams for characters that have been
      misrepresented, banned, non-existent, etc. An exception to this rule is if
      multiple characters are being offered by the same person. You are allowed
      to include the selling information for all characters in a single thread
      provided that you prove your ownership of the characters by having them
      confirm the sales in the thread. All other rules apply normally to the
      character sale.
  2:
    headline: You must disclose whether or not the character being sold has a negative balance in its wallet and the amount.
    details: >
      As the ISK received for the character sale is transferred directly to the
      character for sale, that character gets in virtually all cases a positive
      ISK balance. It's up to the seller to remove only so much ISK as that the
      character is still in the plus prior to transfer.
  3:
    headline: You must disclose if there are kill rights on the character for sale.
    details: >
      Kill rights you possess on other characters are to be treated as assets
      and not included in the character listing.
  4:
    headline: The character being sold must receive the ISK for the purchase and only ISK.
    details: >
      Characters may not be sold in exchange for items.
  5:
    headline: Please note that if a character has a negative ISK balance that character cannot be transferred until it has a positive amount of ISK.
  6:
    headline: The sell post must reflect the character correctly.
    details: >
      Posting that the character you're selling has more skillpoints or ISK
      than it actually has is a bannable offence. Similarly, a seller must
      disclose whether jump clones are located in 0.0, lowsec or highsec space
      and may for example not claim the character for sale character is able to
      fly ship X or Y when that is clearly not the case.
  7:
    headline: You may not extract skillpoints from a character after it has been advertised for sale.
    details: >
      Character sales threads must accurately represent
      the character's state. Extracting skill after a character has been
      advertised for sale will be considered character sales scamming, and
      reprimands will be issued as such.
  8:
    headline: Items cannot be listed among the character's valuable assets, only skills, implants and reputation.
    details: >
      You are buying/selling the character ONLY and nothing else. Ships and
      items can be readily bought or sold on the market for ISK.
  9:
    headline: You may only bump threads ONCE Per day.
    details: >
      Date is determined by the date on the forum, not the date where you live.
      An exception is made for posts made to finalize a sale. You may reply to
      the threads with bids or questions regarding the character/s. All other
      posts are off topic and will be removed. Answering posts of this nature
      will be counted as your daily bump.
  10:
    headline: The new owner of the character may NOT pass himself off as any previous owner.
  11:
    headline: The character for sale must be from an active account, you cannot trade characters from/to inactive accounts.
  12:
    headline: The character being sold must be in an NPC corporation.
    details: >
      This must be true [u]at the time of posting, and for the entire duration
      of the sale/auction thread being active.[/u]
  13:
    headline: Characters on trial accounts or not older than 14 days may not be sold or transferred to other accounts.
  14:
    headline: The selling of accounts is prohibited, characters may only be sold individually.
  15:
    headline: The owner of the character being sold is responsible for paying CCP the character transfer fee.
  16:
    headline: The seller MUST inform their corporation that the character is being sold.
    details: >
      Prior to leaving a corporation, the character to be sold MUST send a
      corp-wide EVE mail stating that they are going to be sold and will be
      leaving for an NPC corporation.
  17:
    headline: When a character is sold, the buyer must modify the topic title to reflect this.
    details: >
      This is in order to help other forum patrons know what characters are still available.
  18:
    headline: Lottery style sales are not permitted.
    details: >
      Auctions and buyouts are the appropriate method for selling a character.
  19:
    headline: All scams involving character transfers are strictly prohibited, and are a bannable offence.
  20:
    headline: ISK transferred by the buyer must be returned if the sale is not completed.
    details: >
      The ISK that a buyer sends when attempting to purchase a character is
      considered to belong to him until such a time as the character being
      purchased has been delivered to the account of his choosing. If the
      character sale is not completed, the ISK must be returned in full to the
      potential buyer.
  21:
    headline: Customer support may aid with some misplaced ISK transfers.
    details: >
      Whenever a character is transferred before the seller has moved the ISK
      received from the sale to another one of their characters, the Customer
      Support team will return that ISK to the rightful owner. The buyer cannot
      expect to receive both the character and the ISK that they paid to
      purchase it.
  22:
    headline: All character transfers have a 10 hour waiting period for security reasons.
  23:
    headline: Down-payment plans are not supported by CCP Customer Support.
    details: >
      As a seller, you are agreeing to a certain amount of ISK only, which is
      to be paid in one payment. Once again, any forms of scams regarding
      character sales are strictly prohibited.
  24:
    headline: All skill training must be paused before transferring the character.
    details: >
      Characters cannot be transferred while having an active skill queue.
  25:
    headline: The location of the character must be disclosed.
    details: >
      The location of the character must be disclosed and whether it is in
      high security, low security, null sec or wormhole space. You must also
      state if the character is in space or in a station.
  26:
    headline: Accounts can only be involved in one character transfer at a time.
    details: >
      If either the sending or the receiving account have an ongoing character
      transfer, other transfer attempts will fail.
  27:
    headline:  Accounts that have been previously banned for macro use are not eligible for character sales.
  28:
    headline: Customer Support will not remove bounties placed on characters either as part of a sale, or after they've been transferred to a new owner.
  29:
    headline: The sale of characters with SKINs is permitted.
    details: >
      Prices of characters can be adjusted as seen fit by the seller to reflect
      the value of their skin collection on the character being sold.
  30:
    headline: Posting misleading/false information about the SKIN collection of the character being sold is a bannable offence.
    details: >
      Any attempts at misleading a buyer regarding SKINs that a character
      possess, or any false representation of skin ownership during a
      character sale will be treated as an attempt at characters sales
      scamming, and will be subject to the full penalties of an attempted
      character scam, including potential suspension of accounts.
  31:
    headline: Posts in the sales thread once the character has been successfully sold should not be edited.
    details: >
      Any information disclosed about the characters may not be removed.
