      from any member of CCP staff.
  12:
    headline: Discussion of forum moderation is prohibited.
    details: >
      The discussion of EVE Online forum moderation actions generally leads to
      flaming, trolling and baiting of our ISD CCL moderators. As such, this
      type of discussion is strictly prohibited under the forum rules. If you
      have questions regarding the actions of a moderator, please file a
      support ticket under the Community & Forums Category.
  13:
    headline: Spamming is prohibited.
    details: >
      Spam is defined as the repetitive posting of the same topic or
      nonsensical post that has no substance and is often designed to annoy
      other forum users. This can include the words “first”, “go back to
      (insert other game name)” and other such posts that contribute no value
      to forum discussion. Spamming also includes the posting of ASCII art
      within a forum post, or the practice of “thread necromancy” which
      involved bumping of old threads for no justifiable reason.

    details: >
      Pyramid quoting is a response to a forum thread that contains the quotes
      of four or more previous posters, sometimes with additional spaces added
      unnecessarily. This kind of posting often distorts the layout of the
      forums and can cause issues with readability for some users.
  15:
    headline: Bumping outside the EVE Marketplace and Alliance & Corporation Recruitment channels is prohibited.
    details: >
      The bumping of posts to alter the order of the thread listing on a forum
      is prohibited outside the EVE Marketplace and Alliance & Corporation
      Recruitment forum channels. Within the EVE Marketplace section of the
      forums, each forum category has its own rules regarding acceptable
      bumping for sales threads clearly listed in the stickies.
  16:
    headline: Posting about bugs and exploits is prohibited.
    details: >
      Bugs and exploits should be reported through the proper channels. Bugs
      should be brought to the attention of CCP by filing a bug report for our
      Quality Assurance department. Discussions about unverified issues in game
      can cause unnecessary panic in the community. When there is an issue that
      the EVE Online community needs to be aware of, it will be communicated via
      an official statement from CCP after thorough investigation.
  17:
    headline: Redundant and re-posted threads will be locked..
    details: >
      As a courtesy to other forum users, please search to see if there is a
      thread already open on the topic you wish to discuss. If so, please place
      your comments there instead. Multiple threads on the same subject clutter
      up the forums needlessly, causing good feedback and ideas to be lost.
      Please keep discussions regarding a topic to a single thread.

      EVE community to ask questions and learn more about EVE. More experienced
      forum users are encouraged to participate by assisting new players with
      helpful and courteous responses. All flaming, trolling and posts of a
      derogatory nature will be deleted, and will be considered a severe breach
      of the forum rules.

      insulting or in breach of the rules will be deleted regardless of how
      valid the ideas behind them may be. Users are also reminded that posting
      with a lack of content also constitutes non-constructive posting.

      in the thread being locked, or a forum warning being issued to the
      off-topic poster.
  28:
    headline: Ban evasion is prohibited.
    details: >
      Forum suspensions and bans are issued when a user grossly violates the
      forum rules. While they are rarely issued, they are applied with the

      ban via the use of alternate accounts will result in additional action,
      and in some instances may result in the permanent revocation of forum
      posting privileges across all accounts. Similarly, having another forum
      user post on your behalf if you are unable to do so may result in an
      extension of your suspension or ban, as well as the user who does so also
      receiving similar reprimand regardless of their warning history.
